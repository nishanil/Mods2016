In this talk, Scott Davis (author/presenter of the O'Reilly video ""Exploring the Architecture of the MEAN Stack"") focuses on the ""naming things"" part of our profession -- specifically, what we call ourselves and what we do.""Computer Scientist"" and ""Software Engineer"" are two popular euphemisms for what we do, but neither is a perfect metaphor. ""Software Craftsmanship"" -- an extension of the Agile Manifesto -- comes closer, but it's still not a perfect fit.We typically self-identify based on our programming language of choice. And our programming language of choice, in turn, colors our view of the world. Come learn about the ""stories"" you tell based on the language you use to tell them, and more importantly -- how to become a Master Storyteller.",We are not Scientists; We are not Engineers; We are Storytellers.,Scott Davis,"A MODS Veteran, in his seventh straight appearance, Scott Davis is the founder of ThirstyHead.com, a training and consulting company that that specializes in leading-edge technology solutions like HTML 5, mobile development, Node.js, SmartTV development, web mapping, NoSQL, Groovy, and Grails.
